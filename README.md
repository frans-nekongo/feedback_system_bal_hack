**Crafted with Ballerina 🏗️ ,Kafka and NextJs 🎯**

## 🌟 What is this?

This is my project for the **BALLERINA X NUST** hackathon  a **Dynamic Feedback & Memo System** designed to enhance learning through **iterative feedback**. It's made for students and lecturers to collaborate efficiently during assessments. 

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Help students **learn and improve** through:

1. 📝 Submitting questions for tests.
2. 🚀 Building a test from various students' questions.
3. 📩 Receiving memos for the test from a lecturer.
4. 📊 Lecturers get Analytics for insights into which chapters most questions come from.

---

## 🛠️ How it works

- Students submit their questions. 
- These questions are pooled into a test 🧩.
- Lecturers create a **memo** 🧾 for the test.
- The **memo is released** to students for them to review 💡.
